        <h1>Browser Testing</h1>
        
        <p>Today's audience can choose from quite a large pool of web browsers, each providing a slightly (or dramatically) different experience. As developers, it is our responsibility to choose just how the web pages we build are displayed to those users. This section describes how we, at Capella University, make some of these key decisions.</p>
