    <h3>Code Editors</h3>
    
    <p>A great code editor can spark productivity in exceptional ways. Many developers prefer rudimentary text editors, others prefer powerful integraded development environments (IDEs). What follows is a general listing of some of the more well-known tools, it would be impossible to list them all.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>Coda</dt>
        <dd>
            Coda from Panic software is a powerful IDE with code editing, terminal, remote file management, and help documentation all built into one UI. Aiming to be a one stop shop for your web development workflow, it also features SVN integration and a new plug-in builder with powerful scripting support and TextMate bundle importing. Finally, code clips and live multi-user editing are also supported. <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>. [Mac]
        </dd>
        
        <dt>TextMate</dt>
        <dd>
            TextMate claims to be the "Missing Editor" for Mac OS X. A general purpose editor with a sparse interface, the real power is in it's extensibility. Features column selections, recordable macros, snippets, auto-pairing of brackets and other characters, clipboard history, code folding, tab-triggers, tabbed placeholders and mirror typing. And that's just for starters. Anything that can be done via scripts through the Mac command line can be done through custom commands, allowing an extremely high degree of customization and expansion of the feature set. TextMate's "bundle" format has been adapted by many other code editors including the aforementioned e TextEditor. <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a>. [Mac]
        </dd>

        <dt>Sublime Text</dt>
        <dd>
            A relatively new editor, Sublime Text is a new approach in editors. "Open Anything" searches through file names and file contents, with remarkable efficiency. Incredibly powerful selection controls allow editing text in multiple locations at once and the "Minimap" gives you a bird's eye view of the open file so you can find your place easily. Actively being developed, new features are being added and the community around the editor is rapidly expanding. Macros, auto-complete, snippets, build tools, the list of features goes on and on. Supports Linux and Mac starting with version 2.
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. [Linux, Mac, Windows]
        </dd>

        <dt>Notepad ++</dt>
        <dd>
            Notepad++ is a free (free as in "free speech", but also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement, which supports several programming languages, running under the MS Windows environment. <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/about.php">Notepad ++</a>. [Windows]
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Aptana</dt>

        <dt>Espresso</dt>
        <dd>
            Espresso was created by the same fellow that created the innovative CSSEdit CSS editor. Espresso features syntax highlighting, code folding, code completion, document outliner/navigators, projects, powerful find features, and built-in file transfer publishing capabilities. Finally, it has a powerful "Sugar" feature set which allows the creation of custom commands and plugins. <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a>. [Mac]
        </dd>
        
        <dt>BBEdit</dt>
        <dd>
            BBEdit is the grand-daddy of Mac code editors for web development.
