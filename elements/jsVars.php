    <h2>Variables, ID &amp; Class</h2>
    
    <p>All JavaScript variables shall be written in either completely lowercase letter or camelCase. The one exception to this are Constructor functions, which are capitalized by tradition. All <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> declarations in CSS shall be written in only lowercase. Neither dashes nor underscores shall be used. </p>
