    <h2>Doctype</h2>
    
    <p>A proper Doctype which triggers standards mode in your browser should always be used. Quirks mode should always be avoided.</p>
    
    <p>A nice aspect of HTML5 is that it streamlines the amount of code that is required. Meaningless attributes have been dropped, and the <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration has been simplified significantly. Additionally, there is no need to use <code>CDATA</code> to escape inline JavaScript, formerly a requirement to meet XML strictness in XHTML.</p>
