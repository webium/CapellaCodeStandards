    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    
    <p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-webstandards/index.html" target="_blank">HTML5</a> is a new version of HTML and XHTML. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank">HTML5 draft</a> specification defines a single language that can be written in HTML and XML. It attempts to solve issues found in previous iterations of HTML and addresses the needs of <em>web applications</em>, an area previously not adequately covered by HTML. (<a href="http://html5.org/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
    
    <p>We will use the HTML5 Doctype and HTML5 features when appropriate.</p>
    
    <p>We will test our markup against the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C validator</a>, to ensure that the markup is well formed. 100% valid code is not a goal, but validation certainly helps to write more maintainable sites as well as debugging code. <b>We do not guarantee code is 100% valid, but instead assure the cross-browser experience is consistent</b>.</p>

    <p>For HTML5 Documents we use a modified version of <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">H5BP</a> modified for our own project needs. <a href="https://github.com/webium/CapellaBoilerPlate" target="_blank">Fork the Github repository</a>.</p>
