    <h3>Naming Conventions for Selectors</h3>
    
    <p>It is always preferable to name something, be it an ID or a class, by the nature of <strong>what it is</strong> rather than by <strong>what it looks like</strong>. For instance, a class name of <code>bigBlueText</code> for a special note on a page is quite meaningless if it has been changed to have a small red text color. Using a more intelligent convention such as <code>noteText</code> is better because when the  visual style changes it still makes sense.</p>
