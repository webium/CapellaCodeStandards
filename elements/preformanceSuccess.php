    <h2>Create success metrics with the client</h2>

    <p>These should be customized to your client and project and done before the wireframing phase. These goals should be reasonable from a technical POV, as well as testable.</p>
    
    <strong>Some goals that would be appropriate:</strong>
    
    <ol>
        <li><i class="icon-minus"></i> The slowest browser supported must go from an empty cache to fully loaded and initialized within 5 seconds.</li>
        <li><i class="icon-minus"></i> Hover states (and other 'instant' changes) should respond within 100ms.</li>
        <li><i class="icon-minus"></i> Animations should appear smooth, with jumpiness occurring &lt; 15% of the time (across all browsers).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>For load-time based goals, it's important to define the benchmark system. Something like <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank">PageTest</a> is a good option. Additionally, goals may be defined for multiple pages, for example: the two most popular landing pages (e.g. homepage and support).</p>
    
    <p>If the client has more aggressive goals than are reasonable with the intended design, expectations need to be set across the board, priming the team that performance goals are going to be paramount.</p>
