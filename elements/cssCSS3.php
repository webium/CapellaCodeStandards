    <h3>Use CSS3</h3>
    
    <p>You can do a lot of new things with the added features in the CSS3 spec, many of which are not yet fully supported by all the major browsers. That doesn't 
    mean they can't be used today. For the things that aren't supported there are fallback libraries or other 'polyfills' which you can use to fill in the holes where
    browsers may be lacking some support of a new feature.</p>
    
    <p>There are also browser specific properties or prefixes that can be used to style things too. We recommend using <a href="http://prefixr.com">Prefixr.com</a> to 
    make sure you include all the different prefixed browser properties for the sake of cross-browser support.</p>
