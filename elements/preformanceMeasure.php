    <h2>Measure performance during QA</h2>

    <p>QA teams should also prioritize performance related tickets alongside visual, functional, and usability issues. Developers and QA should determine how that priority will be assigned. During QA, the success metrics should be tested regularly.</p>

    <strong>Tools to test with</strong>

    <ul>
        <li><i class="icon-minus"></i><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/" target="_blank">YSlow</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/" target="_blank">Page Speed</a>, <a href="http://stevesouders.com/hammerhead/" target="_blank">Hammerhead</a>, <a href="http://msfast.myspace.com/" target="_blank">MSFast</a>, <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank">PageTest</a></li>
    </ul>

    <strong>When performance goals aren't met, there are three options:</strong>

    <ol>
        <li><em>Redevelop the code</em> - profile, discover bottlenecks, refactor code, optimize to target faster execution in the browser</li>
        <li><em>Drop the feature</em> - turn it off for slower browsers only</li>
        <li><em>Redesign approach of the UI</em> - perhaps the design could use a tweak which would bypass the issue entirely</li>
    </ol>

    <p>With this approach, we think all parties have a better chance of having aligned expectations heading in as well as a more sensible workflow in dealing with performance challenges.</p>
