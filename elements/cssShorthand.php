<h3>Shorthand</h3>
    
    <p>In general, CSS shorthand is preferred because of its terseness, and the ability to later go back and add in values that are already present, such as the case with margin and padding. Developers should be aware of the <abbr title="Top Right Bottom Left">TRBL</abbr> acronym, denoting the order in which the sides of an element are defined, in a clock-wise manner: Top, Right, Bottom, Left. If <em>bottom</em> is undefined, it inherits its value from <em>top</em>. Likewise, if <em>left</em> is undefined, it inherits its value from <em>right</em>. If only the <em>top</em> value is defined, all sides inherit from that one declaration.</p>
